##Notes to Grader: 

This is my proWebservice application. I used Prof Gerber's video, and examples for inspiration. To my knowledge, every requirement has been met, and the code is commented thoroughly.

##Regarding Authentication: 
I have applied Thymeleaf Security, which does not secure objects however it conceals what different user roles are able to see.
As such, you should login with username: user , password: user to view the webservice as a user_role.
Alternatively, to be able to create, read, update and delete the content of the site, you should login as username: admin, password: admin.

Admittedly, there is not much purpose to logging in under the user roler. It doesn't have any real added functionality, as an unathenticated user does.

##API Notes: 

The RESTful API allows for all CRUD operations. 

READ ALL (READ): 

READ SINGLE EPISODE (READ): 

DELETE EPISODE (DELETE):

UPDATE EPISODE (UPDATE):
