##Notes to Grader: 

This is my proWebservice application. I used Prof Gerber's video, and examples for inspiration.

I have applied Thymeleaf Security, which does not secure objects however it conceals what different user roles are able to see.
As such, you should login with username: user , password: user to view the webservice as a user_role.
Alternatively, to be able to create, read, update and delete the content of the site, you should login as username: admin, password: admin.
